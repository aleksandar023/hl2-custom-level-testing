# Half-Life 2 Custom Level QA Project

### Intro

This test plan outlines the manual QA process for the "The Tunnels System" section of my custom Half-Life 2 level "Coast”. The focus of the project is to verify gameplay-critical logic and ensure reliable player progression through all enemy encounters and puzzles. The Content side of testing is planned for future iterations.


### Deliverables

Below is a list of all documentation created during the testing process:

* 📎 **[Design document](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g8vPvZ)** - A reference document outlining the rationale behind key design decisions, including gameplay mechanics, level layout, narrative elements and primary inspirations
  
* 📎 **[Test Plan Document](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/main/hl2-custom-level-test-plan.md)** – A document outlining the objectives, scope, strategy, environment, and exit criteria used in testing the level.

* 📎 **[Gameplay and Logic Checklist](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/eb85b0661592b8e2e0afdaf15278467a1480a820/hl2_custom_level_checklist.md)** – A detailed checklist covering all map zones (A1–A9), scripted events, enemy encounters, puzzles, pickups, and transitions. Used to drive and document test coverage.

* 📎 **[Bug Report Log](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/main/hl2-custom-level-bugs.md)** – A log of all identified bugs, including bug summaries, reproduction steps, observed and expected results, severity, environment and attachments

* 📎 **[Test Summary Report](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/main/hl2-custom-level-summary-report.md)** – A concise overview of testing outcomes, including test tasks, results, newly discovered and reopened defects, encountered issues or trends, and any other relevant findings

### Summary

I really enjoyed working on this project, building and testing the level side by side made the whole process more fun and insightful. Knowledge about the gameplay logic and its structure in the Source engine allowed me to create more targeted checklists, achieve better test coverage, and more easily detect edge cases. Going forward, I want to dive deeper into other parts of the Source engine and start applying what I’ve learned to other engines too, especially Unreal Engine 5.
