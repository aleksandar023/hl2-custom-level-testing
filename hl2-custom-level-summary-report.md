# Test Plan: Custom Half-Life 2 Level

## Test task:
This testing effort follows a structured manual QA process based on a detailed checklist to validate the “Tunnel System” section (version 1.6)  of the custom Half-Life 2 level titled “Coast.” The primary goal is to verify gameplay-critical logic, including enemy encounters, scripted events, and puzzle progression.

## Checklist test results:


*Total checks:* 178
*Passed:*175
*Failed:* 3
(See full checklist here)


*Newly reported bugs:*

- HL2001 [Level_tunnels_system][A8] – Zombie in the Mines control room does not react to being shot during scripred sequence
- HL2002 [Level_tunnels_system][A8] – Invisible collision pushes the player when pressing button in the Mines control room

*Conclusion:*
The “Tunnel System” section of the custom level “Caves” is functionally stable, with only minor issues observed, specifically, the interruptibility of a scripted sequence and a minor collision issue with the elevator button. All gameplay-critical logic functions as intended. The level is ready to proceed to the art pass stage.
