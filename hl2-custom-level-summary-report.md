# Test Plan: Custom Half-Life 2 Level

## Test task:


This testing effort follows a structured manual QA process based on a detailed checklist to validate the “Tunnel System” section (version 1.6)  of the custom Half-Life 2 level titled “Coast.” The primary goal is to verify gameplay-critical logic, including enemy encounters, scripted events, and puzzle progression.

## Checklist test results:  


* **Total checks:** 178  
* **Passed:** 175  
* **Failed:** 3  
> (See full checklist here)  

* 📎 **[Gameplay and Logic Checklist](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/eb85b0661592b8e2e0afdaf15278467a1480a820/hl2_custom_level_checklist.md)**


## Newly reported bugs:*

* [HL2001 [Level_tunnels_system][A8]–Zombie in the Mines control room does not react to being shot during scripred sequence](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/main/hl2-custom-level-bugs.md)
* [HL2002 [Level_tunnels_system][A8]–Invisible collision pushes the player when pressing button in the Mines control room](https://github.com/aleksandar023/hl2-custom-level-testing/blob/main/hl2-custom-level-bugs.md)

## Conclusion:  
The “Tunnel System” section of the custom level “Caves” is functionally stable, with only minor issues observed, specifically, the interruptibility of a scripted sequence and a minor collision issue with the elevator button. All gameplay-critical logic functions as intended. The level is ready to proceed to the art pass stage.
